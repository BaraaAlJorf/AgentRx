Radiology Report:
EXAMINATION:  CHEST (SINGLE VIEW)

intubation with temp wire placement  // please verify placement of ET tube and
right sided temp pacing wire   Contact name: ___: ___   
please verify placement of ET tube and right sided temp pacing wire

IMPRESSION: 

In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a right
IJ temporary pacer that extends to the region of the right ventricle.  No

and out of view.


 EXAMINATION:  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Q111 CT HEAD

INDICATION:  ___ woman status post cardiac arrest.

TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images of the brain were obtained without

History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ yo female with a past medical history of 
CAD with a 1 vessel CABG (SVG to LAD) in ___ who presents with 
chest pressure.  She woke up at 8 am with substernal chest 
pressure.  It was severe initially.  She took SL NTG x3 with 
relief of CP for a short period of time.  The CP radiated to her 
right side and eventually down both arms.  She reports 
diaphoresis, but denied associated nausea, vomiting, 
lightheadedness or dizziness.  She reports that she has felt 
mildly SOB since her recent pneumonia (first diagnosed appox ___ 
weeks ago).  She denied worsening dyspnea.  Her cough has 
improved substantially and is very minimal at this time.  She 
went to her PCP's office and was found to have a new LBBB and 
anterior ST elevations.  She was transferred to the ED. She 
received Plavix 300mg, Aspirin, boluses of heparin and 
integrillin. Code STEMI was called and went to the cath lab.  
Cath showed occluded SVG, Native 3vd, occluded proximal LAD. 
Wiring the LAD was difficult and there was concern about a 
possible dissection. One BMS was placed in the proximal LAD. 
Distal LAD is diminutive past ___ septal and diag branches.   
She has been hemodynamically stable with HR 60-70s and SBP 
120-130s.  On the floor, she is currently chest pain free and 
feels well.
.   
.  
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of deep 
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of 
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools 
or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All 
of the other review of systems were negative.  
.  
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, 
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, 
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Radiology Report:
CHEST RADIOGRAPH

INDICATION:  Hypoxia, evaluation for infiltrate or edema.

COMPARISON:  ___.

FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a right basal opacity, most
likely to represent pneumonia, has newly appeared.  There also is blunting of
the right costophrenic sinus, suggesting a small accompanying pleural
effusion.

Otherwise, no focal parenchymal opacity suggesting an infectious disease. 
Normal size of the cardiac silhouette, slight tortuosity of the thoracic
aorta.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 INDICATION:  ___ female with hypoxia.

COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs available from ___ and ___.

UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  
The previously seen right bibasilar opacity has increased in density and size,
concerning for progressive pneumonia. Of note, the patient has had a prior
right lower lobe pneumonia seen on the ___ radiograph. There is a hazy
opacity at the left base, which may represent atalectasis or a new early
consolidative process. The remaining areas of the lungs are clear with no
evidence of pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Increased size and density of the right basilar opacity is concerning for
progression of pneumonia. Given a previous history of pneumonia in this area,
followup through complete resolution of this current pneumonia is recommended.
If there is persistent consolidation in this area, a CT is recommended to rule
out an obstructive mass.
2.  New hazy opacity at the left base may represent a new consolidation.

Findings discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ at 10:50AM ___. Per
discussion, this patient has had a more recent pneumonia of her right lower
lobe at an outside hospital, and CT will be performed to rule out an
obstructing entity. 

 PROCEDURE:  CT chest without contrast.

REASON FOR EXAM:  Heavy smoking history, recent history of diagnosis
unresolved with two courses of antibiotics.

TECHNIQUE:  MDCT chest performed without IV contrast.  5-mm and 1.25-mm axial
slices were acquired with coronal and sagittal reformats.

COMPARISON:  No previous CT was available for comparison.

FINDINGS:  Dense homogeneous consolidation in the right lower lobe (3.45)
contains multiple air bronchograms. Less extensive right basal consolidation
was present on chest radiographs approximately one year ago. Diffuse nodules
throughout the remaining lungs predominate in the middle lobe, right middle
lobe and right lower lobe with relative sparing of the left lower lobe and
lung apices.  These nodules range in size from 1 to 4 mm.  A right pleural
effusion is minimal, and no pathologically enlargement of mediastinal or
axillary lymph nodes is present.The airways are widely patent to subsegmental
level bilaterally. The aorta, and heart size are normal with no pericardial
effusion. Calcification is severe in the coronary arteries, the pulmonary
artery is normal.

A fatty structure appears adherent to the lateral right atrial wall abutting
an area of atrial calcification could be an interatrial lipoma.
The left lobe of the thyroid is heterogenous and enlarged at 21 x 27 mm.

Limited review of the upper abdomen reveals multiple cystic structures in both
kidneys and high attenuation dependent material in the gallbladder most likely
small stones.

No destructive or sclerotic bone lesions are present.  Degenerative changes
throughout the thoracic spine are moderate.

IMPRESSION:
1)Severe right lower lobe consolidation, progressed or recurrent over a year,
and extensive, new diffuse lung nodules most readily explained by multifocal
bronchioalveolar carcinoma.  Alhernatively, the multiple lung nodules could
also be metastases from an extrathoracic malignancy including thyroid
carcinoma.

2)Diffuse severe coronary artery calcification.

3)Probable interatrial lipoma.

4)Bilateral renal cysts.  Small gallstones.

The case was posted to the critical findings dashboard for direct notification
of the referring physician.

Demographics:
 - Age: 80
 - Gender: F
 - Ethnicity: WHITE

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ year-old female with a history of NSCLC 
(stage IV) who presents with shortness of breath.
.
The patient was in her usual state of health until the evening 
before admission when she began to feel somewhat short of 
breath.  The next morning, this sensation persisted, so she 
became concerned.  She also reports a few day history of a 
non-productive cough.  Denies sick contacts, recent travel or 
sedentary lifestyle.  She denied chest pain, fever, chills, 
dizziness, lightheadedness or syncope.  She presented to the ED 
where she was found to be hypoxic to the ___ on room air.
.  
In the ED, she was placed on a non-rebreather with sats up to 
the high 90's.  Attempts were made to wean her to NC but they 
were unsuccessful, as she was satting 88% on 4L NC.  She 
remained afebrile in the ED but was found to have WBC of 17.  
Given that, she received levofloxacin and vancomycin.  Blood 
cultures were drawn prior to antibiotic administration.  CXR did 
not show PNA, but demonstrated progression of known lung cancer. 
 She underwent a CT head to rule out metastases, which was 
negative.  On transfer, patient was afebrile with HR- 77, BP- 
112/49, RR- 16, SaO2- 98% on 15L NRB  
.
On transfer to the ICU, the patient was stable and comfortable.  
Sats were 97% on 5L NC and 95% high-flow with a face-tent.

Radiology Report:
AP CHEST 4:42 A.M. ___

HISTORY:  Hypoxia and a white count.

IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:

The extent of consolidation in the left lower lung has increased substantially
since ___, even since ___.  I suspect that in addition to
widespread bronchoalveolar carcinoma there is new pneumonia.  The volume of
any pleural effusion is indeterminate, at least small on the right.  Heart
size is top normal.  Extensive nodulation and consolidation in the right lung
is fully attributable to disseminated adenocarcinoma.
 HISTORY:  ___ female with hypoxia.

STUDY:  Bilateral lower extremity venous ultrasound.

FINDINGS:  Grayscale and color Doppler sonographic imaging was performed of
the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, peroneal, and
posterior tibial veins.  Normal compressibility, flow and augmentation was
demonstrated.
