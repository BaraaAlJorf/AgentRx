 - Ethnicity: BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN

History of Present Illness:
___ y/o woman with history of HTN and T2 DM (non-insulin 
dependent), admitted to OSH (___), for dyspnea and single 
episode of syncope. Ms. ___ reports that she has been feeling 
increasing DOE starting 2 days PTA walking to and from her 
bathroom. She originally attributed this to accidentally taking 
twice her regular dose of HCTZ. She felt slightly better 1 day 
PTA, but on morning of admission, she was walking in her kitchen 
when she became SOB with new sensation of LH. The next thing she 
remembered was waking up on the floor. Per her grandson, she had 
lost consciousness and fallen. She denies any chest pain 
throughout these events and does not think she sustained any 
injuries to her head or elsewhere due to her syncopal fall.

Past Medical History:
HTN
T2DM (not on insulin)

burden

TECHNIQUE:  Grey scale, color, and spectral Doppler evaluation was performed
on the bilateral lower extremity veins.

COMPARISON:  None.

FINDINGS: 

This study is limited due to patient body habitus.

There is normal compressibility, flow and augmentation of the bilateral common
femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins.  Limited evaluation of the
calf veins demonstrates normal color flow, but compressibility could not be
assessed.

 - Gender: M
 - Ethnicity: WHITE

History of Present Illness:
___ male known to our service, who was discharged from ___ 
after a stay for resecton of a R fronal brain tumor diagnosed to 
be GBM (Glioblastoma multiforme).  Today, he suffered a 
witnessed fall at Rehab. Fall was witnessed by RN at facility, 
positive LOC, question of transient CPR, then transported to 
___. Ambulance flow sheet indicates that there was no trauma 
at the time of the fall.

Past Medical History:


Past Surgical History:
Not available

Social History:

Family History:
non-

Medications on Admission:



Radiology Report:
INDICATION:  ___ man with right frontal tumor status post resection.
Question worsening of tumor refilling of cyst.

COMPARISON:  Multiple head CTs, most recent ___ and head MRIs, most
recent ___.

TECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion
axial images were obtained before gadolinium.  Axial and sagittal T1 and axial
and coronal MP-RAGE images were acquired following gadolinium.

FINDINGS:  The patient is status post right frontal craniotomy for debulking
of right frontal lobe tumor.  Blood products and air are again seen within the
surgical site, with a decrease in the amount of pneumocephalus.  Mass effect
of the associated edema appear unchanged since head CT from yesterday, with
continued compression of the right ventricle and shift of midline structures
of approximately 21 mm.

On diffusion-weighted images, large areas of decreased signal are seen,
consistent with areas of slow diffusion within the frontal lobe mass.  On
post-contrast images, there is an enhancing rim of the main lesion with areas
of residual enhancement seen anteriorly, medially, laterally, and inferiorly.
Again noted is another smaller enhancing mass within the right temporal lobe,
and two small areas of enhancement posterior to the smaller lesion, consistent
with intraventricular seeding.  No new areas of abnormal enhancement are seen.

IMPRESSION:  Large area of residual tumor burden within the right frontal lobe
mass.  Mass effect unchanged from CT scan yesterday. Other areas of abnormal
enhancement unchanged. No new areas of abnormal enhancement seen.
 HISTORY:  ___ male with right frontal mass, stereotactic protocol.

COMPARISON:  MRI brain, ___, and CT head ___.

TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images of the head were obtained within a
stereotactic frame with the administration of IV contrast.

FINDINGS:  Streak artifact from the stereotactic frame limits evaluation. A
right frontal lobe resection cavity bed, containing fluid, air, and high
attenuating hemorrhage posteriorly is similar from prior study.  There is rim
enhancement along the resection cavity, particularly anteriorly and medially,
again suspicious for residual tumor burden as noted on MRI of the head,
___. There is significant mass effect, with obliteration of the
right lateral ventricle and leftward subfalcine herniation of grossly 2.0 cm.
Residual vasogenic edema is seen within the right frontal lobe.

A second enhancing lesion is present within the right temporal lobe, with
early right uncal herniation.  There is mucosal thickening of the ethmoidal
sinuses bilaterally.  Osseous structures reveal right frontal craniotomy
defect.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Right frontal lobe resection cavity containing fluid, air, and a small
amount of residual hemorrhage, with an enhancing rim identified particularly
anteriorly and medially, suspicious for residual tumor burden.
2.  Significant mass effect, with obliteration of the right lateral ventricle
and leftward subfalcine herniation of approximately 2.0 cm.
3.  Right temporal lobe enhancing mass, with early uncal herniation.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH

INDICATION:  ETT placement.

COMPARISON:  ___.

FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, an endotracheal tube has
been placed.  The tip of the tube projects 7 cm above the carina.  The tube
could be advanced by 1-2 cm.  There is no evidence of complications.  The lung
volumes have slightly increased.  The previously described subtle right basal
opacity is no longer visible.  Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged.
 HISTORY:  ___ male with right frontal mass, evaluate postoperatively.

COMPARISON:  ___, at 10:32 p.m.

TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images of the head were obtained without IV
contrast.

FINDINGS:  There are post-surgical changes following a right frontal
craniotomy, with interval placement of a catheter that courses into the right
frontal lobe.  Within the surgical resection bed, there continues to be fluid
as well as a small amount of postoperative hemorrhage, similar in appearance
from the prior study, with residual vasogenic edema within the right frontal
lobe.  There continues to be a marked mass effect with obliteration of the
right lateral ventricle, and leftward subfalcine herniation of approximately
16 mm, grossly unchanged from the prior study.  Assessment of the resection
cavity is limited without IV contrast.

Early right uncal herniation is stable, with a known right temporal lobe mass,
not clearly appreciated without contrast.  There has been no other interval
change, without new foci of hemorrhage or acute major vascular territorial
infarction. There is minimal mucosal thickening of the ethmoidal sinuses.
Osseous structures reveal a right frontal craniotomy defect, with subcutaneous
air along the right frontal soft tissues.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Interval placement of a catheter into right frontal lobe, with residual
fluid and hemorrhage within the surgical bed.
2.  Stable continued local mass effect with obliteration of the right lateral
ventricle and leftward subfalcine herniation.

Radiology Report:
EXAMINATION:  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

INDICATION:  ___ year old man with altered mental status, increased urinary
frequency and gait instability of unclear chronicity.  Evaluate for
ventriculomegaly or acute intracranial hemorrhage

TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images images of the brain were obtained without
contrast.

DOSE:  DLP:  1009.26 mGy-cm
CTDI:  ___ MGy

COMPARISON:  None.

FINDINGS: 

There is no evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, edema, or mass.  Prominent
ventricles and sulci are consistent with age-related involutional change.
Hypodensity in the region of the left corona radiata is consistent with
chronic infarct. Periventricular white matter hypodensities are consistent
with chronic small vessel ischemic disease.

There is suggestion of bilateral parietal foramina, which is a normal variant
(see series 3, image 31). No osseous abnormalities seen. The paranasal
sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are clear. The orbits are
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:


1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Findings suggestive of left coronal radiata chronic infarct as described.
3. Please note MRI is more sensitive for the evaluation of acute infarct.
