--- Patient DATA ---

Radiology Reports:
EXAMINATION:  CHEST (SINGLE VIEW)

INDICATION:  PACER WIRE INSERTION

IMPRESSION: 

Fluoroscopic images show placement of a temporary pacer wider that appears to
extend to the right ventricle.  Further information can be gathered from the
procedure report.
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT

INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD, s/p respiratory arrest and
intubation with temp wire placement  // please verify placement of ET tube and
right sided temp pacing wire   Contact name: ___: ___   
please verify placement of ET tube and right sided temp pacing wire

IMPRESSION: 

In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a right
IJ temporary pacer that extends to the region of the right ventricle.  No
evidence of pneumothorax.  Endotracheal tube is now in place with its tip
approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.
Otherwise little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with severe COPD s/p cardiac arrest  // Eval
for interval change

IMPRESSION: 

Compared to prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___
and ___.

Mild pulmonary edema has not resolved.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. 
Pleural effusion, small if any.  No pneumothorax.

Right transjugular temporary pacer lead tip projects over the floor of the
right ventricle.  ET tube in standard placement.  Esophageal probe ends at the
level of the carina.  Transesophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach
and out of view.


 EXAMINATION:  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Q111 CT HEAD

INDICATION:  ___ woman status post cardiac arrest.

TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images of the brain were obtained without
contrast.

DOSE:  Acquisition sequence:
   1) Sequenced Acquisition 10.0 s, 17.0 cm; CTDIvol = 48.8 mGy (Head) DLP =
829.0 mGy-cm.
 Total DLP (Head) = 842 mGy-cm.

COMPARISON:  ___ noncontrast sinus CT.

FINDINGS: 

No sulcal effacement or loss of gray-white matter differentiation.  There is
prominence of the ventricles and sulci suggestive of involutional changes. No
acute intracranial hemorrhage.

There is no evidence of fracture.  Opacification of the maxillary sinuses and
mastoid air cells.  Otherwise the visualized portion of the paranasal sinuses
and middle ear cavities are clear.  The visualized portion of the orbits are
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: 

No evidence of infarction or hemorrhage; however, initial head CT may be
normal in the setting of hypoxic brain injury, so could consider obtaining a
brain MRI for further evaluation if clinically indicated, or a repeat head CT
in 1 day.

RECOMMENDATION(S):  No evidence of large ischemic infarct or intracranial
hemorrhage; however, initial head CT may be normal in the setting of hypoxic
brain injury, so could consider obtaining a brain MRI for further evaluation
if clinically indicated, or a repeat head CT in 1 day.

NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ on the
telephone on ___ at 6:23 ___, 20 minutes after discovery of the findings.
