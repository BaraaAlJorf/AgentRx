Initial CT scanning at ___ showed a CT head with SAH, and

facet at C6-7, R side pleural hemothorax; multiple T-spine 
fractures with T4/5 transverse process, T3/6 - spinus process 
fx; T7 with small amount of retropulsion, L2 transverse process 
fx. Laboratory evaluation notable for stable CBC, chemistries 
but urine tox positive methamphetamines, TCH, and serum ETOH 
180. Patient transferred to ___ for trauma, neurosurgery, 
spine evaluation. Noted to be moving all extremities at ___

No report at OSH or in ___ ED of additional external injuries on 
exam. In addition to prior injuries found on CT the MRI revealed 
a small ventral epidural hematoma at C5-T1 with no significant 
mass effect on the spinal canal, and abnormal high signal within 
the thoracic spinal cord at T6-7, consistent with contusion and 
edema.
