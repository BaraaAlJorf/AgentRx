 - Ethnicity: BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN

History of Present Illness:
___ y/o woman with history of HTN and T2 DM (non-insulin 
dependent), admitted to OSH (___), for dyspnea and single 
episode of syncope. Ms. ___ reports that she has been feeling 
increasing DOE starting 2 days PTA walking to and from her 
bathroom. She originally attributed this to accidentally taking 
twice her regular dose of HCTZ. She felt slightly better 1 day 
PTA, but on morning of admission, she was walking in her kitchen 
when she became SOB with new sensation of LH. The next thing she 
remembered was waking up on the floor. Per her grandson, she had 
lost consciousness and fallen. She denies any chest pain 
throughout these events and does not think she sustained any 
injuries to her head or elsewhere due to her syncopal fall.

Past Medical History:
HTN
T2DM (not on insulin)

Radiology Report:
EXAMINATION:  BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS

INDICATION:  History: ___ with pulmonary embolus, would like to eval for clot
burden

TECHNIQUE:  Grey scale, color, and spectral Doppler evaluation was performed
on the bilateral lower extremity veins.

COMPARISON:  None.

FINDINGS: 

This study is limited due to patient body habitus.

There is normal compressibility, flow and augmentation of the bilateral common
femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins.  Limited evaluation of the
calf veins demonstrates normal color flow, but compressibility could not be
assessed.

There is normal respiratory variation in the common femoral veins bilaterally.

scan, and is consistent with a simple cyst.  The right kidney is unremarkable
without focal lesions.  There is no hydronephrosis.  There is no perinephric
abnormality.

Liver: There is a 4.8 x 5.4 cm (transverse by AP), T2 hyperintense lesion in
segment VII/V of the liver which demonstrates discontinuous peripheral nodular
enhancement with centripetal fill-in, compatible with a hemangioma.

 - Gender: M
 - Ethnicity: WHITE

History of Present Illness:
___ male known to our service, who was discharged from ___ 
after a stay for resecton of a R fronal brain tumor diagnosed to 
be GBM (Glioblastoma multiforme).  Today, he suffered a 
witnessed fall at Rehab. Fall was witnessed by RN at facility, 
positive LOC, question of transient CPR, then transported to 
___. Ambulance flow sheet indicates that there was no trauma 
at the time of the fall.

Past Medical History:


Past Surgical History:
Not available

Social History:

Medications on Admission:



Radiology Report:
INDICATION:  ___ man with right frontal tumor status post resection.
Question worsening of tumor refilling of cyst.

COMPARISON:  Multiple head CTs, most recent ___ and head MRIs, most
recent ___.

TECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion
axial images were obtained before gadolinium.  Axial and sagittal T1 and axial
and coronal MP-RAGE images were acquired following gadolinium.

FINDINGS:  The patient is status post right frontal craniotomy for debulking
of right frontal lobe tumor.  Blood products and air are again seen within the
surgical site, with a decrease in the amount of pneumocephalus.  Mass effect
of the associated edema appear unchanged since head CT from yesterday, with
continued compression of the right ventricle and shift of midline structures
of approximately 21 mm.

On diffusion-weighted images, large areas of decreased signal are seen,
consistent with areas of slow diffusion within the frontal lobe mass.  On
post-contrast images, there is an enhancing rim of the main lesion with areas
of residual enhancement seen anteriorly, medially, laterally, and inferiorly.
Again noted is another smaller enhancing mass within the right temporal lobe,
and two small areas of enhancement posterior to the smaller lesion, consistent
with intraventricular seeding.  No new areas of abnormal enhancement are seen.

IMPRESSION:  Large area of residual tumor burden within the right frontal lobe
mass.  Mass effect unchanged from CT scan yesterday. Other areas of abnormal
enhancement unchanged. No new areas of abnormal enhancement seen.
 HISTORY:  ___ male with right frontal mass, stereotactic protocol.

COMPARISON:  MRI brain, ___, and CT head ___.

TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images of the head were obtained within a
stereotactic frame with the administration of IV contrast.

FINDINGS:  Streak artifact from the stereotactic frame limits evaluation. A
right frontal lobe resection cavity bed, containing fluid, air, and high
attenuating hemorrhage posteriorly is similar from prior study.  There is rim
enhancement along the resection cavity, particularly anteriorly and medially,
again suspicious for residual tumor burden as noted on MRI of the head,
___. There is significant mass effect, with obliteration of the
right lateral ventricle and leftward subfalcine herniation of grossly 2.0 cm.
Residual vasogenic edema is seen within the right frontal lobe.

A second enhancing lesion is present within the right temporal lobe, with
early right uncal herniation.  There is mucosal thickening of the ethmoidal
sinuses bilaterally.  Osseous structures reveal right frontal craniotomy
defect.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Right frontal lobe resection cavity containing fluid, air, and a small
amount of residual hemorrhage, with an enhancing rim identified particularly
anteriorly and medially, suspicious for residual tumor burden.
2.  Significant mass effect, with obliteration of the right lateral ventricle
and leftward subfalcine herniation of approximately 2.0 cm.
3.  Right temporal lobe enhancing mass, with early uncal herniation.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH

INDICATION:  ETT placement.

COMPARISON:  ___.

FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, an endotracheal tube has
been placed.  The tip of the tube projects 7 cm above the carina.  The tube
could be advanced by 1-2 cm.  There is no evidence of complications.  The lung
volumes have slightly increased.  The previously described subtle right basal
opacity is no longer visible.  Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged.
 HISTORY:  ___ male with right frontal mass, evaluate postoperatively.

COMPARISON:  ___, at 10:32 p.m.

TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images of the head were obtained without IV
contrast.

FINDINGS:  There are post-surgical changes following a right frontal
craniotomy, with interval placement of a catheter that courses into the right
frontal lobe.  Within the surgical resection bed, there continues to be fluid
as well as a small amount of postoperative hemorrhage, similar in appearance
from the prior study, with residual vasogenic edema within the right frontal
lobe.  There continues to be a marked mass effect with obliteration of the
right lateral ventricle, and leftward subfalcine herniation of approximately
16 mm, grossly unchanged from the prior study.  Assessment of the resection
cavity is limited without IV contrast.

Early right uncal herniation is stable, with a known right temporal lobe mass,
not clearly appreciated without contrast.  There has been no other interval
change, without new foci of hemorrhage or acute major vascular territorial
infarction. There is minimal mucosal thickening of the ethmoidal sinuses.
Osseous structures reveal a right frontal craniotomy defect, with subcutaneous
air along the right frontal soft tissues.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Interval placement of a catheter into right frontal lobe, with residual
fluid and hemorrhage within the surgical bed.
2.  Stable continued local mass effect with obliteration of the right lateral
ventricle and leftward subfalcine herniation.

Radiology Report:
EXAMINATION:  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

INDICATION:  ___ year old man with altered mental status, increased urinary
frequency and gait instability of unclear chronicity.  Evaluate for
ventriculomegaly or acute intracranial hemorrhage

TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images images of the brain were obtained without
contrast.

DOSE:  DLP:  1009.26 mGy-cm
CTDI:  ___ MGy

COMPARISON:  None.

FINDINGS: 

There is no evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, edema, or mass.  Prominent
ventricles and sulci are consistent with age-related involutional change.
Hypodensity in the region of the left corona radiata is consistent with
chronic infarct. Periventricular white matter hypodensities are consistent
with chronic small vessel ischemic disease.

There is suggestion of bilateral parietal foramina, which is a normal variant
(see series 3, image 31). No osseous abnormalities seen. The paranasal
sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are clear. The orbits are
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:


1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Findings suggestive of left coronal radiata chronic infarct as described.
3. Please note MRI is more sensitive for the evaluation of acute infarct.

Radiology Report:
EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fall, COPD, right shoulder ecchymosis  //
r/o pna, r/o right shoulder fracture, serial exam      r/o pna, r/o right
shoulder fracture, serial exam

IMPRESSION: 

The patient is most likely after left upper lobectomy.  A left mediastinal
shift and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm are stable.  Postradiation
changes along the left mediastinal border are minimal.  Lungs are otherwise
well inflated.  No focal consolidation demonstrated.
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new R PICC  // R DL Power PICC 39cm ___
___   Contact name: ___: ___

TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph

COMPARISON:  ___ from earlier in the day

FINDINGS: 

Interval placement of a right PICC line, the tip projecting over the mid to
lower SVC.

Unchanged leftward mediastinal shift and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm
in keeping with a prior left lobectomy.  No significant interval change in the
appearance of the postradiation changes along the left mediastinal border. 
The right lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.

IMPRESSION: 

Interval placement of a right PICC line, the tip which projects over the mid
to distal SVC.

No other significant interval change since the prior examination.
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with IVH, hypoxia  // eval for heart failure, pna

TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph

COMPARISON:  ___ from earlier in the day

FINDINGS: 

The tip of the right PICC line projects over the mid SVC.

No significant interval change in the appearance of the lung parenchyma since
the prior radiograph.  No new focal consolidation.  No pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: 

No significant interval change since the prior examination.
 EXAMINATION:  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Q111 CT HEAD

INDICATION:  ___ year old man with IVH, SAH, increased lethargy evaluate for
interval change.

TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images of the brain were obtained without
contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations as well as bone algorithm
reconstructions were provided and reviewed.

DOSE:  Acquisition sequence:
   1) Sequenced Acquisition 16.0 s, 17.1 cm; CTDIvol = 46.8 mGy (Head) DLP =
802.7 mGy-cm.
 Total DLP (Head) = 803 mGy-cm.

COMPARISON:  Head CT dated ___ and outside hospital head CT dated ___.

FINDINGS: 

Overall appearance is similar to the recent prior study.  Acute appearing
blood products distend the third ventricle, extend into the fourth ventricle,
and layer dependently within bilateral occipital horns, left greater than
right.  Trace unchanged blood is seen within the temporal horn of the left
lateral ventricle.  The amount of third ventricular distention appears
slightly increased, measuring up to 1.5 cm in the transverse dimension,
previously 1.3 cm (2:13 compared with 3:14).  Subarachnoid hemorrhage within
the left sylvian fissure is unchanged.  There is no subdural compartment
hemorrhage.  Enlargement of bilateral lateral ventricles is unchanged and
consistent with age advanced involutional changes, possibly with a
superimposed component of obstructive hydrocephalus.  Nonspecific
periventricular and deep subcortical white matter hypodensities most likely
represent moderate to severe chronic small vessel ischemic disease.

There is no evidence of fracture.  The visualized portion of the paranasal
sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are clear.  The visualized
portion of the orbits are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:


1. Evolving multicompartment intracranial hemorrhage including slightly
increased distension of the third ventricle.  Subarachnoid hemorrhage is
unchanged and there is no evidence of interval hemorrhage.
2. Unchanged age advanced involutional changes and nonspecific periventricular
white matter hypodensities most likely representing moderate to severe chronic
small vessel ischemic disease.

 This preliminary report was reviewed with Dr. ___
radiologist.

FINDINGS: 

Again seen is a large intraventricular hemorrhage involving the left lateral
ventricle.  A trace amount of blood is present within the atrium of the right
lateral ventricle.  Blood extends into the fourth and third ventricles.  The
intraparenchymal hemorrhage appears centered within the head of the caudate
nucleus, not significantly changed.  An intraventricular shunt is present its
tip which terminates within the frontal horn of the left lateral ventricle, in
stable position.  Ventricular size relative to most recent examination is
overall stable.  Intraventricular blood products are evolving. 
Periventricular hypodensity is consistent with transependymal flow of CSF, not
significantly changed.  There is no shift of normally midline structures. 
Basal cisterns are patent.  There is no evidence of acute large territorial
infarction.  Gray-white matter differentiation appears preserved.

Fluid is seen within the left-sided anterior ethmoidal air cells.  Remaining
visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.  No fracture is identified.  Globes
are unremarkable.  Mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are clear.  An
endotracheal tube is present within the visualized oral cavity.

PATIENT BASELINE SUMMARY:
------------------------
Demographics:
 - Age: 56
 - Gender: F
 - Ethnicity: BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN

History of Present Illness:
___ year old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus with multiple 
recents hospitalization and considerable complications of her 
disease, hypertension, and Graves disease with 3 days of nausea, 
vomiting (~4 times a day), diarrhea, and epigastric pain 
(___). She reports that she has been taking her Lantus, but 
had not continued with her Humalog dosing.  Most recent FSBGs 
for her were in the 300s-400s, but she did not inform any of her 
doctors about this.  She has had markedly decreased PO intake 
over the past 3 days as well.  She also acknowledges that her 
allergies have been a bit less controlled as of late.  She 
initially stated that her loose stools were bright red in color, 
but then explained that she was not sure.  When her vomitous 
started to become darker, she was finally worried enough to come 
to the hospital.  Upon transfer to ___ ED, per EMS report, 
emesis was black/brown. She was very drowsy, but responsive and 
arousable.  She was actively complaining of epigastric pain to 
palpation, without rebound or guarding.

Radiology Report:
EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CHF, COPD presenting with shock and cough 
// fluid vs. infiltrate progression after IVF      fluid vs. infiltrate
progression after IVF

IMPRESSION: 

Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___.

Patient rotation to the right may account in part for the apparent increase in
radiodensity in the right upper lobe just above the minor fissure.  However
the this could be due to aspiration or early pneumonia.  Careful followup
advised.

Pulmonary vascular congestion is more pronounced today than on ___.  Pleural effusions small if any.  Borderline cardiomegaly and
severe tortuosity of the ascending thoracic aorta are chronic.
 EXAMINATION:  SHOULDER ___ VIEWS NON TRAUMA LEFT

INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with shoulder pain  // r/o acute process or
fracutre

TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the left shoulder.  Portable exam.

COMPARISON:  No prior left shoulder radiographs.  Multiple prior chest x-rays
are compared including ___.

FINDINGS: 

Severe left glenohumeral osteoarthritis with effacement of the joint space,
and subchondral sclerosis is present.  There is a large ovoid body in the
region of the axillary recess measuring 3.2 x 1.8 cm, likely degenerative in
nature.  Alternatively, this could reflect sequela of prior injury.  This was
also present on prior chest x-ray of ___.

There is mild acromioclavicular degenerative change.

Distal humeral fracture deformity is partly imaged, better evaluated on
concurrent elbow views.

Narrowing of the acromial humeral interval may reflect underlying rotator cuff
tear.

IMPRESSION:


1. Severe degenerative changes.
2. Large ovoid body in the region of the axillary recess likely degenerative
in nature.
3. Narrowing of the acromial humeral interval may reflect underlying rotator
cuff tear.
 EXAMINATION:  ELBOW, AP AND LAT VIEWS LEFT

INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with shoulder and arm pain  // r/o acute
process or fracture

TECHNIQUE:  Two views of the left elbow.

COMPARISON:  None available.

FINDINGS: 

Portable images with somewhat limited projections.  There is a fracture
deformity of the distal humeral shaft and supracondylar humerus which appears
longstanding with mature callus formation.  Evaluation for effusion is limited
due to projection.  No definite acute fracture is seen.

IMPRESSION: 

Appearances overall compatible with old fracture of the distal humerus.  No
definite acute fracture.

Family History:
Uncle and cousin with leukemia. No other family history of 
malignancy. Parents alive in ___, father with CVA several years 
ago.

Medications on Admission:
The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.
1. Acetaminophen 1000 mg PO Q8H:PRN pain 
2. Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID 
3. Polyethylene Glycol 17


Radiology Report:
EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

INDICATION:  ___ s/p T12 corpectomy and anterior fusion w/ L chest tube
placement  // Confirm L chest placement, ptx

IMPRESSION: 

Small left apical pneumothorax is present with left-sided chest tube in place.
Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 7.3 cm above the carinal and could be
advanced for standard positioning. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal
considering marked patient rotation. Lungs are grossly clear.
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

INDICATION:  ___ year old man with left CT  // interval change

COMPARISON:  ___ p.m.

FINDINGS: 

Rotated positioning.
ET tube present, with tip the top of clavicles proximally 6.6 cm above the
carina. An NG tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm overlying gastric fundus.
Portions of the tuber obscured by the patient's lumbar spine spinal fixation
hardware. There is left-sided chest tube. No pneumothorax is detected. There
is minimal hazy opacity at the left lung base, slightly increased. This is
non-specific in appearance and could represent atelectasis, parenchymal
contusion, or early pneumonic infiltrate. No gross effusion. Allowing for
overlying tubing and materials, the right lung is grossly clear, without overt
CHF, focal consolidation, or effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
grossly unchanged.



IMPRESSION:


1. Left chest tube present, similar in position. No pneumothorax detected.
2. There is minimal hazy opacity at the left lung base, slightly increased.
This is non-specific in appearance and could represent atelectasis,
parenchymal contusion, or early pneumonic infiltrate. Attention to this area
on followup films is requested.
 EXAMINATION:  LUMBAR SINGLE VIEW IN OR

INDICATION:  Laminectomy fusion at T10-L3

TECHNIQUE:   3 lateral views lumbar spine obtained portably in the OR.
Additional post processed views generated.

COMPARISON:  None.

FINDINGS: 

On view #1, an alligator clamp device overlies the posterior elements of the
presumptive L3/4 level. The inferior portion of the fusion construct seen in
the region of the thoracolumbar junction is noted. Compression of the L2
vertebral body is noted. Additional surgical materials are present.

On view # 2, pedicle screws are present at the presumptive L2 and L3 levels.

On view 3, pedicle screws are again seen at the presumptive L2 and L3 levels.
However, the L2 screw projects along the L2 superior endplate and overlies the
intervertebral fusion device. This could be artifact due to projection, but
clinical correlation is requested.

IMPRESSION: 

3 lateral radiographs obtained during posterior fusion procedure. Clinical
correlation requested regarding position of the L2 pedicle screw. Please see
comment above.
 EXAMINATION:  LUMBAR SINGLE VIEW IN OR

INDICATION:   Lumbar laminectomy fusion T10 through L3

TECHNIQUE:  2 lateral views of the low of the spine obtained portably in the
OR. Additional post processed versions generated.

COMPARISON:  Additional intraoperative films obtained the same day.

FINDINGS: 

On view #4, the posterior spinal fusion construct spanning the fractured T12
level is noted, with additional spinal hardware present.

On view # 5, additional pedicle screws have been placed.


IMPRESSION: 

Correlation with real-time findings is recommended for further assessment.
